(ns koyomi.cli
  "Minimal JVM entrypoint for `koyomi.query` against an EDN-seeded MemStore —
  no StateGraph/checkpointer/advisor spun up, just a status read. For a
  process boundary consumer that needs one event's draft status without an
  in-process require across runtimes.

  Usage: `clojure -M -m koyomi.cli <ledger.edn> <event-id>` — prints the
  draft status (\"proposed\"/\"shared\"/\"none\") and exits 0 on \"shared\", 1
  otherwise (so callers can also just check the exit code).

  <ledger.edn> holds the same shape as `koyomi.store/demo-data`'s :drafts map
  (at minimum {:drafts {\"<event-id>\" {:status :shared}}})."
