  "Demo: drive a schedule share through one ScheduleActor.

    ingest        register an event from an activity's due-at (observe → facts)
    draft ev-board   known, non-first-contact attendees, no conflicts → phase 3
                     auto-commits (a casual commit)
    share ev-board   sharing is always high-stakes → human sign-off →
                     mock-scheduleport builds the ICS + calls the distributor
    draft ev-blocked drafting doesn't gate on consent → commits
    share ev-blocked consent-blocked attendee → HARD HOLD (un-overridable)
    draft ev-conflict-new  overlaps an existing event on a shared attendee →
                     SOFT double-booking escalate (not held) → human still
                     approves it (a real conflict, but not un-overridable)
    phase 0          draft in ingest-only phase → held (phase-disabled)
