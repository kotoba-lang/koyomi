(ns koyomi.distribute
  "REAL Resend-based Distributor for `koyomi.scheduleport`'s `:event/share` —
  the koyomi analog of `cloud_itonami.mail`. `koyomi.scheduleport/mock-
  scheduleport` stays the runnable, offline DEFAULT; `resend-scheduleport`
  here is an opt-in real `ScheduleTarget`, swapped in only via `koyomi.
  operation/build`'s `:scheduleport` opt — never the default, same discipline
  as `koyomi.kotoba/kotoba-store` (a real backend that's still a constructor
  call away, not a always-on side effect).

  Only this namespace touches the network (`java.net.http`) or
  `RESEND_API_KEY` — `koyomi.scheduleport` (ICS building), `mail.*`, and
  `mailer.*` all stay pure, mirroring `cloud_itonami.mail`'s own charter
  verbatim (\"Only this namespace touches the network ... mail.* and
  mailer.* stay pure\"). `jvm-http-fn` below is a byte-for-byte port of
  `cloud_itonami.mail/jvm-http-fn` (same `{:url :method :headers :body} ->
  {:status :body}` convention as `koyomi.kotoba/jvm-http-fn` too) so
  `send-invite!` can be tested with a stubbed `:http-fn` instead of a real
  Resend call.

  `kotoba-lang/mailer`'s `request` builds the Resend envelope (from/to/
  subject/text/html + auth capability) — this ns does NOT reimplement that.
  It only adds what `mailer.core/message-wire` doesn't build yet: an
  `:attachments` entry carrying the ICS `koyomi.scheduleport/ics-string`
  already produced, base64-encoded, `text/calendar` MIME type, filename
  `invite.ics`. `koyomi.scheduleport/ics-string` does NOT emit a VCALENDAR
  `METHOD:REQUEST` property (verified — grepping `METHOD` across
  scheduleport.cljc is a zero hit), so this is deliberately a plain `.ics`
  attachment, not a full RFC 5546 REQUEST — claiming `;method=REQUEST` in the
  attachment's content-type while the ICS body itself lacks a matching
  `METHOD` property would be an inaccurate, mismatched attachment.

  Attendee-email assumption (see the koyomi live-integration report for the
  explicit call-out): `koyomi.scheduleport/ics-string` already renders every
  `:calendar/attendees` entry directly as an `ATTENDEE:mailto:<entry>` line —
  i.e. this codebase's existing convention treats attendee strings as email
  addresses already, with no separate id → email lookup table (`koyomi.
  model/contact`'s `:attendee` field just mirrors the same identifier for
  consent bookkeeping; it is not a second, email-shaped field). This ns keeps
  that exact same assumption for the real Resend `to` list: each
  `:calendar/attendees` entry is used AS the recipient email address
  verbatim. `koyomi.store/demo-data`'s seed attendees (`\"att-alice\"` etc.)
  are placeholder ids, NOT real addresses — `mail.message/assert-valid-
  message` will throw `:invalid-recipient` if a real send is attempted
  against them, by design (a real deployment must populate
  `:calendar/attendees` with real email addresses for both the ICS ATTENDEE
  lines and this real send path to be meaningful)."
