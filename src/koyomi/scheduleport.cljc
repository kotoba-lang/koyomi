(ns koyomi.scheduleport
  "ScheduleTarget port — the ONLY place an event actually leaves the building.
  A schedule-LLM proposal is data (a `:draft` record) until a human approves
  sharing it; `share!` is called exactly once, after that approval, by
  `koyomi.operation`'s commit step. `calendar.model` has ZERO ICS-export or
  sharing concept (verified — grepping ics|ical|share|publish across it is a
  zero hit), so koyomi owns building the ICS string itself here, then hands
  it to an injected Distributor fn for actual invite delivery (same
  injection shape as kekkai/tayori's ports). `mock-scheduleport` is the
  default — a deterministic in-memory target so the actor is runnable and
  testable with no network/creds.

  `slack-scheduleport` below is one such opt-in Distributor (Slack
  `chat.postMessage`, alongside a separately-landing Resend-email one) —
  still not a replacement for mock-scheduleport, just another
  `distributor` a caller may inject into it. See README's 'Slack
  Distributor (owner setup required)' section for what the human owner
  still has to do (register a Slack app, obtain a bot token) before it is
  usable; no live Slack call is made anywhere in this repo, including its
  test suite."
